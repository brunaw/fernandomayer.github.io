```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(fig.path = "static/img/")
set.seed(1)
```

Here we will write some text and below a very silly random number
generation:

```{r}
x <- rnorm(10)
x
```

A local figure:

![](/img/icon.png)

And this would be a silly histogram:

```{r histo}
hist(x)
```
